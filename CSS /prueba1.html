		<p id="parrafoverde">“We were just talking: ‘If and when the first case happens—it could be this week, we just don’t know,’ ” Pálmason recalled.
			 “And then, two hours later, we got the call.” A man who’d recently been skiing in the Dolomites

		<P class="text"">I was travelling around, wherever the spirit led me, and it was already past 7 p.m.
			 when I arrived at the hot-springs town and got off the train. Autumn was nearly over,
			  the sun had long since set, and the place was enveloped in that special navy-blue darkness particular to mountainous areas.
			   A cold, biting wind blew down from the peaks, sending fist-size leaves rustling along the street.

			Anyone who clicked was greeted by apparently endless footage of K-pop stars engaged in elaborate choreography. 
			Stans are as savvy as they are righteous—when the tag changed to #whitelifematters and then #whiteoutwednesday, they simply regrouped and reëngaged.

			The juxtaposition of those two things—Snyder’s book, 
			which was published shortly after Donald Trump took office,
			 and my stack of papers, which focus mostly on aspects of American democracy—has
			  not been lost on me. If it were simply a contest of words, and the contest were confined to my desk,
			   democracy would be winning. But we know this is not the case.
